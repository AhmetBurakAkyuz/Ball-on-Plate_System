 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 43 and contact element type 42 has been set up.  The

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
