 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.547   TIME= 21:48:46
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.688   TIME= 21:48:47
 Maximum contact stiffness 4.151783761E+16 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.688   TIME= 21:48:47
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.688   TIME= 21:48:47
 Certain contact elements (for example 93195 & 93242) overlap with       
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       3.688   TIME= 21:48:47
 Certain contact pairs (for example 52 & 50) overlap with other.
