 This SOLVE command is only used to generate the matrices needed to      
 perform the linear perturbation analysis.  The linear perturbation      
 analysis corresponds to time = 1 (load step = 1, substep = 1).  No      
 results are being written.                                              

 *** NOTE ***                            CP =       2.266   TIME= 21:49:06
 The prior(base) analysis is LINEAR, use the total load prescribed in    
 the linear perturbation process to calculate the critical               
 eigen-buckling loads.                                                   
 *WARNING*: Some contact elements on contact surface specified by real   
 constant set 24 belong to symmetric contact (e.g.  0), some do not.

 the same behavior.                                                      
 ANSYS will deactivate the current pair and keep its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Linear contact is defined

 Default pinball region factor PINB           0.25000    
 *WARNING*: The default pinball radius may be too small to capture       
 contacting zone under small sliding assumption.  Redefine the pinball   
 radius if necessary.

 pinball radius if it is a true geometric gap/penetration.  Decrease

 A linear perturbation analysis with contact usually requires turning on 
 large deflection option (NLGEOM,ON) in the base analysis.  Otherwise    
 the down-stream analysis will not use the current deformation           
 configuration which might lead to inaccurate solution or even memory    
 error.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.
