CAD Drawing can only be opened with a SOLIDOWRKS 2020+ version.
MATLAB/Simulink files are created and can be opened with 2022a+ version.
ANSYS files are constructed using 2022R2 version.
"Simulation_RefPoint.slx" and "Circle_Simulation.slx" are the simulation files.
Simulation environment requires the manual implementation of an extra library which is also presented with files.
For library implementation: Right Click "Simscape-Multibody-Contact-Forces-Library-22.1.5.1" >> Add to Path >> Selected Folders and Subfolders.
Don't forget to first extract "Simscape-Multibody-Contact-Forces-Library-22.1.5.1" from rar to normal file.
